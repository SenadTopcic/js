// 1. Deposit some money
// 2. Determine number of lines to bet on
// 3. Collect a bet amount
// 4. Spin the reels
// 5. Check if the user won
// 6. If the user won, add winnings to the bank
// 7. If the user lost, subtract the bet amount from the bank
// 8. Repeat steps 2-7 until the user quits or runs out of money
// to start the game, run node project.js in the terminal
//The command npm i prompt-sync is used to install a Node.js package called prompt-sync.
//
//The prompt-sync package allows you to easily accept user input in a synchronous manner in a Node.js application.
// It provides a simple way to prompt the user for input and receive their response.
//
//By installing prompt-sync using npm i prompt-sync, you are adding the package as a dependency to your 
//Node.js project, allowing you to use its functionality in your code.
//
//Once installed, you can require the prompt-sync package in your Node.js code to start using it. For example:

//const prompt = require('prompt-sync')();
